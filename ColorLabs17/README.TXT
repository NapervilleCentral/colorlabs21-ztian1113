Who critiqued you and what was the critique?

1. Dad: add another color bucket to add more dimension
2. Lily: try to change the subintervals; the picture is lighter so shift them more towards 255
3. Mr Hayes: shift the colors back a little so there are more highlights on the face but still folds, liked the color scheme
4. Emma: lessen the purple a bit so that there can be more red and orange

FINAL is trial 3
